        <h1>WHAT WE DO</h1>
        <p>
          At Finless Foods, we envision a future where fish meat for human consumption is grown outside of whole fish. We use fish stem cells harvested from living fish to produce fish meat.
        </p>
        <p>
          We plan to revolutionize the seafood industry by providing appetizing alternatives to existing products without impacting the environment. We will produce healthy fish meat which will be fresh and free of mercury, one of the major concerns with natural fish products. We envision a future where we can sustainably benefit from all the advantages of this immense nutritional source without ruining one of the Earth's most important ecosystems.
        </p>
        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p>
        Finless Foods is an early stage biotechnology company with the mission to develop and mass manufacture pioneering marine animal food products for human consumption. Our objective is to create seafood sustainably using scientific cellular agriculture technologies to provide a cost-effective and appetizing alternative to conventionally caught and commercially farmed seafood. Our products will also be healthier to consume and better for the environment than conventionally produced seafood.
      </p>
      <h1>WHY?</h1>
      <p>
        53% of Earth’s fish stocks are fully exploited, but consumption of fish continues to increase.  Our hauls of fish will be smaller and smaller as the years go by, and governments will continue limiting fishing in order to protect our ocean ecosystems.  This scarcity of fish meat means that the price of fish will stay on its rising course, putting healthy fish protein out of reach for all but the richest of consumers.  The pollution of the ocean also allows for heavy metals like mercury to accumulate in fish, limiting the recommended consumption amounts of this otherwise nutritious and healthy source of energy.
      </p>
      <h1>OUR SOLUTION</h1>
      <p>
        Our goal is to create fish meat from fish stem cells in a brewery-like environment for mass consumption.  This fish meat will retain the taste and texture of natural fish and it will be cheaper than wild-caught or aquaculture fish since:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
<li>-All of the energy input will be used building edible meat without bones, scales, and other parts of the fish we don’t eat</li>
<li>-No energy will be burned off by the daily life cycle of a fish and all of the movement that entails </li>
<li>-It won’t require large fleets of gas-guzzling boats and thousands of fishermen to obtain </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
      The supply of our products will remain steady as it won’t be dependent on depleting fish stocks or environmental protection regulation, as well as scaleable to meet fish consumption needs worldwide.  It can bring fresh fish to areas far inland (even in the desert), since the production facilities can be built anywhere and aren’t dependent on a nearby body of water from which to harvest fish from.  Our fish meat will be free from heavy metal buildup since it won’t be produced in the ocean, making it a healthy option for everybody.
    </p>
    <h1>TECHNOLOGY</h1>
    <p>
      By using a combination of well-established and cutting edge cell culture techniques, a small sample of cells from a living marine animal will be cultured and structured in a brewery-like environment in the same shape as a fish fillet.  We will first isolate and culture up a cell line from real fish that will become the muscle and fat tissue we want.  We will then design a growth media for this cell line that will keep cost down and allow for stable growth.  Once we have this we will lay the cells out on a structure that will shape them to both look and have the texture of real fish meat, becuse it will be - on a cellular level - real fish meat.
